# Collaborative-filtering-implementation

# Description:
**Collaborative filtering** is one of the most common methods for building recommendation systems. It predicts the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users. There are two main types:

* User-based: Recommends items by finding similar users

* Item-based: Recommends items similar to the ones the user has liked

We’ll implement a user-based collaborative filtering method using cosine similarity between users.

# ✅ What It Does:
* Simulates a user-item rating matrix with random values

* Computes cosine similarity between users

* Recommends items for User1 based on ratings from similar users
